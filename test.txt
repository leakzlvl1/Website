To make sure github linked correctly and that i implicated a change
from within  my terminal

git status
git add test.txt
git commit add -m "Add test.txt as a test file"
(commits change)

Now to push it 

git push -u origin main (if first time)
git push (if you alresdy have)

BELOW IS THE COMMANDS AND WHAT I HAD TO WORK AROUND

~/Website $ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~/Website $ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
